== Description ==

AIM Style Vault lets you add persistent CSS to your WordPress theme that can be organized into stylesheets and published
just like a post. You'll never again have to worry about losing changes made to the style.css file of your theme. In fact, you 
can switch back and forth between themes and use AIM Style Vault stylesheets to preserve special styles for each. The AIM Style 
Vault stylesheets are generated using a custom post type, then compressed and served to the document header, 
resulting in the fast application of custom CSS. Stylesheets are applied using the top-to-bottom cascade so that recent stylesheet 
entries will override earlier entries.

**Requirements:**
AIM Style Vault requires that the wp_head() tag is included in the theme header.php file. If it is not present, contact your theme's 
author and request that it be included.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add CSS styles in the Custom CSS stylesheet editor? =

Use proper CSS syntax including the selector, property and value. Properties and values are separated by a colon and a semi-colon should follow the value.
The properties and values for any selector should be enclosed in brackets: e.g. .selector-name { width: 100%;}

= What happens to the styles when I change themes? =

You can create new special styles for the new theme. If two themes use the same selector, you may want to unpublish the stylesheet created for the previous
theme and create a new style for the selector in the new theme.

= Can I add comments to the stylesheets? =

Yes, just use the proper syntax, enclosing the comment in slashes and asterisks: /* comment goes here */.
